<p align="center"> Welcome to my website! I am a freshman at the University of Maine.  I am majoring in business.  My dad owns a local business, so I'm planning on taking it over one day.  I enjoy traveling, photography, fashion, and playing tennis.  I have been lucky enough to travel with my family throughout my life.  I have been to many different states throughout the United States.  I have also been to Canada, Mexico, and different islands in the Caribbean.  I would love to continue traveling the world in the future!
When I graduate from the University of Maine, I would love to go to a fashion school either in Boston or New York.  It is my dream to become a fashion stylist one day.    </p>
